Galaxy Zoo Solution
===================

The source code in this project was originaly used to generate solutions for the Galaxy Zoo Challenge which was originaly posted to Kaggle on December 20, 2013 and closed on April 4, 2013 (http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge). The objective of the challenge was to detect morphological galaxy features in jpg images which where originaly captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey project and to predict how participants of the galaxyzoo project (www.galaxyzoo.org) would score these features (ie. what percentage of participants would say yes or no when asked if the galaxy contains a particular feature).
